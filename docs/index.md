# Pickling and Exception Handling in Python 

## Introduction  
This paper documents the process of creating a Python script that demonstrates pickling and structured error-handling. The product of this week’s assignment is a simple program, Assignment07.py, that lets dog-oriented businesses manage their database of dog clients. Topics covered in this assignment include binary files and Exceptions, which were part of week 7’s lessons. Additionally, the paper discusses online resources that were used for this assignment.
